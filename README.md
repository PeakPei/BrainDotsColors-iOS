<b> Description </b>
<br><br>
Game rule is simple. Just hit the balls with their colors. 
<br>
The powerful influence of Color rules our choices in everything from the food we eat and the clothes we wear to the cars we buy. Color preferences are deeply rooted emotional responses that seem to lack any rational basis. This is all because our brain loves colors but only few of them. We have created a game using only those colors. You will really feel happy when you win or lose but you will definitely love the game. So hope you would give it a try. Try the game and share your reviews.
